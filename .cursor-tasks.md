## 3. One-Story-Point Task List in Markdown

We have a **team of 10** front-end developers (AI software agents). Each must have tasks that **don't** depend on others completing their tasks first. Below is a list of tasks, broken down so each developer can independently build or refine a part of the system in **Storybook**. All tasks are "1 story point" each.

### **Software Developer 1**

1. [x] **Create Button Atom**

   - Build a reusable `Button` component with variants (primary, secondary, disabled) and basic styling.
   - Add Storybook stories for each variant (hover, click, disabled states).

2. [x] **Create Icon Atom**
   - Build a basic `Icon` component that can display SVG icons by name or path.
   - Provide stories showing different icons, colors, and sizes.

### **Software Developer 2**

1. [ ] **Create ProgressBar Atom**

   - Build a `ProgressBar` atom that takes a percentage prop and shows a filled bar.
   - Add stories for 0%, 50%, 100% fill, and custom colors.

2. [ ] **Create TextField Atom**
   - Implement a `TextField` with label and placeholder.
   - Provide stories for standard text, error state, and disabled states.

### **Software Developer 3**

1. [ ] **Create Image Atom**

   - Build an `Image` atom that can display a given image URL with optional alt text.
   - Include stories showing different sizes, shapes (circle, square), and placeholders.

2. [ ] **Create PetStatDisplay Molecule**
   - Combines `ProgressBar` (from Developer 2) + label text to display a single stat (like hunger).
   - Add stories showing different stat labels and progress states (e.g., Hunger: 75%).

### **Software Developer 4**

1. [ ] **Create PetActionGroup Molecule**

   - Renders multiple `Button` atoms (e.g., Feed, Play, Clean), optionally includes `Icon`.
   - Provide stories for 3-4 button combos with different labels/icons.

2. [ ] **Create PetImageCard Molecule**
   - Incorporates `Image` (from Developer 3) plus text overlay for pet name or level.
   - Show different styled text overlays in Storybook (pet name top vs bottom).

### **Software Developer 5**

1. [x] **Create AdoptionForm Organism**

   - Combines `TextField` (Developer 2) + `Button` (Developer 1) + optional `Image` placeholders.
   - Add stories for the entire form (pet name input + "Adopt" button).
   - Include validation states (empty name triggers error, etc.).

2. [x] **Create PetDashboard Organism**
   - Combines `PetImageCard` (Dev 4), `PetStatDisplay` (Dev 3) for multiple stats, and `PetActionGroup` (Dev 4).
   - Show a "complete dashboard" story with example stats, e.g. hunger=80, happiness=50, etc.

### **Software Developer 6**

1. [ ] **Create AdoptionTemplate**

   - Layout container that includes `AdoptionForm` (Dev 5) with some static text (like "Choose Your Pet").
   - Provide Storybook story demonstrating the page structure (header, form, etc.).

2. [ ] **Create PetDashboardTemplate**
   - Layout container that includes `PetDashboard` (Dev 5) within a typical page structure (header, maybe a background).
   - Provide a story that shows how it all looks in a "full-screen" layout scenario.

### **Software Developer 7**

1. [ ] **Create AdoptionPage**

   - Next.js page (in Storybook, we'll mock it or build a story) that renders `AdoptionTemplate` (Dev 6).
   - Make sure it has minimal business logic.
   - Provide a story demonstrating the page in an "Adoption" scenario.

2. [ ] **Create PetDashboardPage**
   - Next.js page that renders `PetDashboardTemplate` (Dev 6).
   - Add a story in Storybook to illustrate the full page.
   - Sample data for stats, pet name.

### **Software Developer 8**

1. [ ] **Create AboutPage**

   - Simple static page with text or styled content.
   - Provide a story that shows how the "About" info might be displayed (maybe a short paragraph, images, or disclaimers).

2. [ ] **Add Basic Interaction Logic**
   - In Storybook, show how the "Feed" button might increment hunger stat or "Play" button might change happiness.
   - This can be done with Storybook's `args` + `controls`, or a local state simulation.
   - Provide at least one story demonstrating that stats update after an action.

### **Software Developer 9**

1. [ ] **Create ShopInterface Organism**

   - If we have time, build a shop UI with items displayed in a grid, each with a `Button` to "buy."
   - Provide story for a sample item list, e.g. "Bone - 5 coins," "Magic Potion - 10 coins."

2. [ ] **Create ShopPage**
   - Next.js page that includes `ShopInterface` in a simple layout.
   - Provide a story that displays the entire shop page with sample items.

### **Software Developer 10**

1. [ ] **Create Leaderboard Organism**

   - Displays a list of top pets with name, age, happiness, etc.
   - Provide a story showing a sample leaderboard with 5-10 entries.

2. [ ] **Create LeaderboardPage**
   - Next.js page that uses `Leaderboard` with sample data.
   - Provide a story to illustrate the final layout.
